Load this at the root of your SD card or Loader

Make sure "Mods" and "riivolution" folders are at the root

Loads files after "files" folder so stuff like "g3d" "mint" or "lyt" when extracting the disc from dolphin I need to test if it can load the sys and gecko codes...

Example: Mods/g3d/step/chara/hero/kirby/base/Pink.brres.cmp
